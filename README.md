# Vite + Module Federation

Adding games from separate repositories / URLs (remotes) to host.

[Demo](https://games.alanlai.app)

## Objective:

A quick game is a good game.
Just focusing on creating a game in one night or two.
Think of a challenge and code up a solution.
Refactoring and styling may be added later.

## Demonstration:

Micro-frontends can be managed separately.
This main wrapper does not need know about the code for each game.

## Possible future updates:

- Add more games
- Create library for shared resources e.g. styling
- Creating a shared state to track score
